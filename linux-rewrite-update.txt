Main issues:

Unable to find a way to Restart the Game Server after the Map is generated and Admin Files are created.
While writing a script to setup a fresh 7 Days To Die Game Server for the first time.
  I Could not find a reliable way to parse the output of telnet and issue the shutdown command: 
    The first time you start the server, the map is being generated and admin file is created in the map folder.
    After generating Admin file, I always wanted to automatically add the Administrators of the server.
    However after automatically adding the administrators, the Game Server needs restart. 
    And the only way to restart Game Server that I know of: connect to the server via telnet and issue
      the shutdown command, then rerun the GameServer to load Admin Files. As mentioned I was unsucessful.
      I tried linux package "Expect", but I never managed to actually make it work properly.
    So, Manually Restarting the Game Server is needed, if you want for the scripts to work on the generated files such as Admins File.
  

About:
This script will Setup Environment for a New 7 Days To Die Dedicated Server
It will create a new Linux User named "steam"
It will install steamcmd into /home/steam/.steam/steamcmd 
It will download 7 Days To Die Game Server Files to (/home/steam/.steam/steamcmd/7dtd) folder
It will change configurations of serverconfig.xml file (/home/steam/.steam/steamcmd/7dtd/serverconfig.xml)
It will not start the server automatically to generate Map or Admin File. (See Main Issue above)
