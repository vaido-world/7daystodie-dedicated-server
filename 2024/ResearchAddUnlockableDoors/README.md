This mod replaces some outdoor doors with white unlockable doors for testing.

Note: The standard securedoors class does not allow to unlock doors even if lockpicking property is added.


This approach might be buggy.
You might see that admin placing outdoor blocks can not close the doors once they are locked by the same adminL due them being of class secure containers.

However it works if you are a regular player and not an admin placing these outdoor non-player blocks.
